The Tractus VLC Controller is a simple wrapper around the VLC Media Player for Windows 10 and up. It allows for fine-grain control over video playback. 

- Pause on last frame by default
- Keep video playback window separate, with no OSD, no resizing when video resolution changes
- Enable "blackout" of videos
- Enable a "holding slide" over top of videos
- Volume slider from 0% to 200%

With auto-play enabled, this can be used as a basic digital signage application.
